## Challenge

The task for this challenge was to create a function that would take a variety of strings, replace sensitive data (such as credit card information) with asterisks, then return the new string. This was difficult as the strings used the formatting conventions of other objects such as queries and arrays. 

### Reflections

I had a week to complete the task, but due to life (working part time, other tech tests due at similar times) I didn't get to commit to this one as thoroughly as I'd have liked. Ultimately, I only ended up being able to spend two days on it -  that was to learn the basic conventions of PHP and create a function. While there's parts that I'm pleased with all things considered, I don't think it's my best work by any means. 

### Next steps

- make the search function case insensitive
- find a way to use the stripos function to make the search function more efficent and less bulky
- the arrayString function is inefficient and bulky. It's not incoroporating best practices by any means. It needs to be streamlined and altered to return an array-like string, not an array. 
- find a way to get the xmlString function to return an exact duplicate of the input string - it's missing the Request tags.
